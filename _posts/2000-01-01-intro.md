The 17th Biennial Festival of New Music will take place January 29â€“31 on the campus of the [Florida State University][FSU]'s [College of Music][COM]. Nearly 30 composers from across the country have been selected to attend performances of their works; this year the festival will comprise seven different concerts featuring acoustic and electroacoustic compositions for both small and large ensembles. The festival will also feature presentations and works by our special guests, composer David Lang and pianist Ursula Oppens.
