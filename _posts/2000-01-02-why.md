#  vr is future 

*“There’s always a richer, more immersive medium to experience the world,”* ***Mark Zuckerberg*** said way back in 2014. *“And after video, the next logical step is fully immersive virtual reality.”*

Oh-- go see [some examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUUnp6Z_wc)!

- ***Virtual Reality (VR)*** is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. Unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places the user inside an experience. Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed and able to interact with 3D worlds.
 
- Ordinary glasses show a single image but 3D and virtual reality glasses contain polarised lenses which show two images, one per each eye. These images appear to give an illusion of depth which is a particular feature of CAVE environments.- Only **two things** to edit:

Sound good? Let's go!

Wait but what it takes to develop such environment

1. Does it take 3-D modelling?
2. Does it take long lines of code or specific language to make these apps?
3. Does it take javascript or ajax for animation purpose?
4. .....................................?
***NO***
